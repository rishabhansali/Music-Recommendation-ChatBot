# Music-Recommendation-ChatBot

MARC, short for Music Analysis and Recommender Chatbot, uses user input to enable a music
recommender system. MARC can stream and suggest songs based on genre, artist, popularity and
previous streaming history. This is all made possible by using unsupervised learning & web scraping
techniques and tools such as python, flask, HTML and CSS.

Creating a recommendation system is hence a healthy addition to any streaming platform. The
underlying goal of such a system would be to deliver an overall personalized timeline for users that
not only saves the usersâ€™ browsing time but also offers a hassle-free streaming experience.
